# uhregmisc

Miscellaneous Helper Functions For The Univ. Regensburg Tinnitus Data.

**Important:** For most of the functions to work, you would need to put into the `data-raw/` folder the original dataset (`200622_uhreg.xlsx`) which cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to copyright reasons. 

## Overview

- `data-raw/uhreg.R`: preprocessing script for the raw UHREG data
- datasets `uhreg` and `data_dict` (+ json export at `inst/extdata/data_dict.json`)
- function `discretize_score()` for discretizing a numeric questionnaire score according to predefined cutoff values from literature.
- Shiny app to explore missingness / available data.

## Installation

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("unmnn/uhregmisc")
```

```{r load-uhregmisc}
library(uhregmisc)
```

## Shiny app on data missingness 

```{r shiny-missingness, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("app-ume", "app-ume.png"))
```

Provides an overview of missing data patterns. 
You can specify a data subset based on:

- visit type: screening, baseline, interim visit, final visit and/or followup
- treatment (10 most frequent treatment types are selectable)
- gender
- age range

Additionally, you can choose to order questionnaires (y-axis) either by mutual missingness (determined by a hierarchical clustering) or just alphabetically by their name.

### How to run app

```{r start-ume-app, eval = FALSE}
# When running the first time, create the necessary pre-processed dataset with:
source("app-ume/ume_prep-data.R")
# Afterwards, the folder `app-ume` should contain the file `data.rds`.
# Then, just run the app via:
shiny::runApp("app-ume")
```

## Data preprocessing steps

The script `data-raw/uhreg.R` preprocesses the UHREG data.

- part of column name representing the questionnaire is written in caps
- establish consistent name convention: prefix of variable name (part until first underscore) represents the name of the corresponding questionnaire
  - example: `TQ_q01` &rarr; `TQ` questionnaire
  - meta variables, e.g. patient ID or treatment type, have the prefix `.META`
- some variables are renamed for consistency of chronology, e.g. `TSCHQ_q36_1_otologic_additional` instead of `TSCHQ_q361_otologic_additional`
- abbreviations in names: `q` instead of `question`, `lvs` instead of `last_validation_status`
  - example: `TBF12_q10` instead of `TBF12_question10`
- in column names, zero-padding is added to allow for alphabetical ordering, e.g. `TBF12_q01` instead of `TBF12_q1` (there is also a `TBF12_q10`)
- all BDI columns are removed due to complete missingness
- variable types are converted where appropriate:
  - `TSCHQ_q02_sex` to `factor`
  - `.META_patient_id` to `character`
  - `.META_visit_day`, `TSCHQ_q05_begin_tinnitus` to `date`
- `-1` values are replaced with `NA_integer_` where appropriate
- some (sub-)scales are created:
  - TFI subscales: intrusive, sense of control, cognitive, sleep, auditory, relaxation, quality of life, emotional
  - TQ subscales: emotional distress, cognitive distress, intrusiveness, auditory perceptual difficulties, sleep disturbances, somatic complaints
  - MDI: depression categorization

<!-- - Is there any documentation for the audiological assessment? There are a lot of negative values (e.g. -1 for AUDIO_duration) and "repdigits" (999, 99999) - I assume they have a special meaning. -->
- What do the columns with "last_validation_status" mean? What do their values (-1, 0, 1) mean?
- Documentation for "v_exp_tschq_q36_otologic" and "v_exp_tschq_q361_otologic_additional"

## TODOS

- Improve rudimentary documentation for `uhreg` and `data_dict`
- Add function that dummifies categorical variables

## `data_dict`

```{r data_dict, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
data_dict

var <- "TSCHQ_q09_perception"
data_dict %>% filter(variable == var) %>% pull(description)
data_dict %>% filter(variable == var) %>% pluck("value", 1)
```

## `uhreg` overview

```{r uhreg-skim, cache = FALSE}
skimr::skim_without_charts(uhreg)
```
